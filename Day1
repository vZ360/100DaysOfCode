1.Write a program in main.py that prints the same notes from the previous lesson using what you have learnt about the Python print function.

Output 
Day 1 - Python Print Function
The function is declared like this:
print('what to print')


Code:

print("Day 1 - Python Print Function")
print("The function is declared like this:")
print("print('what to print')")


2. Debugging Practice

output 
Day 1 - String Manipulation
String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.
e.g. print("Hello " + "world")
New lines can be created with a backslash and n.


code:
#Fix the code below ðŸ‘‡

print("Day 1 - String Manipulation")
print("String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.")
print("e.g. print(""Hello "+""+""+" "" world"")")
print("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")
